# ðŸ“§ Spam Mail Detection

This project is a **Machine Learning-based Web Application** that classifies emails as either **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)**. It combines a trained spam detection model with a simple, user-friendly interface to let you quickly test and analyze email text.

The project demonstrates a **practical application of Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for detecting spam content, showcasing how ML models can be integrated into real-world applications.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Spam / Ham Classification** â€“ Instantly detect if an email is spam or not.
- **Interactive Web Interface** â€“ Easy-to-use frontend for testing any email text.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline** â€“ Cleans and transforms text for accurate predictions.
- **Machine Learning Model** â€“ Trained using a real-world email dataset.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
You will need to download the dataset from Kaggle before running the project:  
ðŸ”— [Email Spam Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/purusinghvi/email-spam-classification-dataset)

This dataset contains labeled email texts that help the model learn patterns distinguishing spam from ham.
